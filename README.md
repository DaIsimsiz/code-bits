# Isimsiz's Code Bits
Hello! This is a repository I have created to put my small code projects on the internet. Feel free to use them however you want!

- The folder named **"Examples"** is for code bits that deliberately use some lesser-known or confusing syntaxes. These are for teaching how to use them properly.
- The folder named **"Bits"** is for code bits that do not specifically use any syntax in particular. These provide examples to help you get a grasp on common coding practices.
